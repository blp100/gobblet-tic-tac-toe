## Game Instructions

Gobblet Tic-Tac-Toe combines the gameplay of Tic-Tac-Toe with the strategic elements of Gobblet Gobblers. The objective is to create a line of three pieces of your color horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

Players take turns performing the following actions:

1. Place: On your turn, place one of your pieces onto an empty cell of the 3D game board.
2. Gobble: If your piece can gobble up an opponent's smaller piece, you can replace it with your own, regardless of the opponent's color.
3. Move: You can move one of your pieces already on the board to an empty cell, as long as it's larger than the piece you're moving it onto.
